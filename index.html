        <h2 class="section-title">About the Workshop</h2>
        The recent surge of multimodal large models has brought unprecedented progress in connecting language, vision, audio, and beyond.
        Yet, despite their impressive performance, most existing systems remain constrained to fixed modality 
        pairs, lacking the flexibility to generalize or reason across arbitrary modality combinations. 
        The first edition of the Any-to-Any Multimodal Learning (A2A-MML) workshop aims to explore the next frontier of multimodal intelligence—developing systems capable of understanding, aligning, transforming, and generating across any set of modalities. We organize the discussion around three foundational pillars:
        <!-- <ul class="bullets">
          <li><em>Multimodal representation learning</em>, which seeks to learn generalizable and disentangled representations that capture both shared and modality-specific information;</li>
          <li><em>Multimodal transformation</em>, which investigates architectures and principles enabling seamless translation, fusion, and adaptation across heterogeneous modalities;</li>
          <li><em>Multimodal collaboration</em>, which studies how modalities cooperate, complement, or conflict with each other to achieve coherent reasoning and world modeling.</li>
        </ul> -->

        <p>For the latest papers and datasets, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/any2any-mllm/awesome-any2any" target="_blank" ><b>Awesome-Any-to-Any-Generation</b></a>. This repository is regularly updated and provides valuable resources for your submission.</p>
        <!-- By bringing together researchers from vision, language, audio, 3D, robotics, and cognitive science, this workshop aims to establish a roadmap toward any-to-any multimodal intelligence, where machines can perceive, reason, and communicate across modalities as fluidly as humans do. -->

        <h3>Topics and Themes</h3>
        <p>We welcome all relevant submissions in the area of multimodal learning, with emphasis on any-to-any multimodal intelligence, such as:</p>
